["Oxidative DNA damage correlates with cell immortalization and N43ENTITY expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs expression has been extensively studied in hepatocellular carcinoma but little is known regarding the relationship, if any, with inflammation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), host' s repair mechanisms and cell immortalization.", "This study aimed at assessing the extent of oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-8-OHdG) in different phases of the carcinogenetic process, in relation to DNA repair gene polymorphism, telomeric dysfunction and to the expression of several microRNAs, non-coding genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and death.", "METHODS: Tissue samples obtained either at surgery, [neoplastic (HCC) and adjacent non-cancerous cirrhotic tissues (NCCT)] at percutaneous or laparoscopic biopsy (patients with HCV or HBV-related hepatitis or patients undergoing cholecystectomy) were analysed for 8-OHdG (HPLC-ED), N1ENTITY (a DNA repair gene) polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), N2ENTITY activity, telomere length (T/S, by RT-PCR), Taqman microRNA assay and N3ENTITY/N4ENTITY mRNA (RT-PCR).", "Fifty-eight samples from 29 HCC patients (obtained in both neoplastic and peritumoral tissues), 22 from chronic hepatitis (CH) and 10 controls (cholecystectomy patients-CON) were examined.", "RESULTS: Eight-OHdG levels were significantly higher in HCC and NCCT than in CH and CON (p = 0.001).", "N5ENTITY activity was significantly higher in HCC than in the remaining subgroups (p = 0.002); conversely T/S was significantly lower in HCC (p = 0.05).", "N41ENTITY were down-regulated in the majority of HCCs while N42ENTITY was up-regulated.", "A positive correlation was observed among 8-OHdG levels, disease stage, N7ENTITY activity, N8ENTITY and N9ENTITY/N10ENTITY levels.", "In HCC, N39ENTITY expression correlated positively with N11ENTITY activity, 8-OHdG levels and N12ENTITY/N13ENTITY mRNA.", "CONCLUSIONS: The above findings confirm the accumulation, in the progression of chronic liver damage to HCC, of a ROS-mediated oxidative DNA damage, and suggest that this correlates with induction of N14ENTITY activity and, as a novel finding, with over-expression of N40ENTITY, a microRNA that plays a role in both the apoptotic process and in cellular proliferation pathways.", "MYCN-regulated N37ENTITY inhibits secretion of the tumor N16ENTITY (N17ENTITY) in neuroblastoma.", "The N18ENTITY is frequently amplified in neuroblastoma.", "It is one of the most consistent markers of bad prognosis for this disease.", "N19ENTITY (N20ENTITY) is a secreted protein of the N21ENTITY of N22ENTITY regulators.", "It functions as a tumor suppressor in a range of cancers, including neuroblastoma.", "MYCN was recently found to downregulate N23ENTITY.", "In this study, we show that MYCN knockdown in MYCN-amplified (MNA) neuroblastoma cell lines increases secretion of endogenous N24ENTITY to the culture media.", "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 20 nt long single-stranded RNA molecules that downregulate messenger RNAs by targeting the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR).", "Many miRNAs regulate genes involved in the pathogenesis of cancer and are extensively deregulated in different tumors.", "Using miRNA target prediction software, we found several MYCN-regulated miRNAs that could target the 3' UTR sequence of N25ENTITY, including N38ENTITY, N35ENTITY and N36ENTITY.", "N28ENTITY expression from a reporter vector containing the N29ENTITY was decreased when this construct was cotransfected with N47ENTITY, N48ENTITY or N49ENTITY in HEK293 cells.", "Mutation of the N50ENTITY seed sequence in the 3' UTR completely rescued the observed decrease in reporter expression when cotransfected with N44ENTITY and N45ENTITY.", "Antagomir and miRNA-mimic transfections in neuroblastoma cell lines confirmed that N33ENTITY secretion to the culture media is regulated by N46ENTITY.", "Consistent with reports from other cancers, we found N34ENTITY to be expressed in the endothelium of primary neuroblastoma samples and to be absent in tumors with MYCN amplification.", "Our data demonstrate that MYCN-regulated miRNAs are able to modulate the expression of the tumor suppressor DKK3 in neuroblastoma."]
