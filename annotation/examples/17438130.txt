Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha regulates a microRNA-mediated signaling cascade responsible for hepatocellular proliferation. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) leads to hepatocellular proliferation and liver carcinomas. The early events mediating these effects are unknown. A novel mechanism by which PPARalpha regulates gene expression and hepatocellular proliferation was uncovered. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiling demonstrated that activated PPARalpha was a major regulator of hepatic miRNA expression. Of particular interest, let-7C, an miRNA important in cell growth, was inhibited following 4-h treatment and 2-week and 11-month sustained treatment with the potent PPARalpha agonist Wy-14, 643 in wild-type mice . let-7C was shown to target c-myc via direct interaction with the 3' untranslated region of c-myc . The PPARalpha-mediated induction of c-myc via let-7C subsequently increased expression of the oncogenic mir-17-92 cluster; these events did not occur in Pparalpha-null mice . Overexpression of let-7C decreased c-myc and mir-17 and suppressed the growth of Hepa-1 cells. Furthermore, using the human PPARalpha-expressing mouse model, which is responsive to Wy-14, 643 effects on beta-oxidation and serum triglycerides but resistant to hepatocellular proliferation and tumorigenesis, we demonstrated a critical role for let-7C in liver oncogenesis. Wy-14, 643 treatment did not inhibit let-7C or induce c-myc and mir-17 expression. These observations reveal a let-7C signaling cascade critical for PPARalpha agonist-induced liver proliferation and tumorigenesis.
