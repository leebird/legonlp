TI  - Oral cavity infection: an adverse effect after the treatment of oral cancer in
      aged individuals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The immune compromised patients after treatment of oral cancer may
      have a chance of infection by drug-resistant opportunistic microbes. We
      investigated the occurrence of opportunistic microorganisms in aged individuals
      receiving follow-up examinations after treatment of oral cancer in China.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: These patients were used as test group and the respective
      age grouped healthy individuals as control group. In this study, the oral cavity
      microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast were taken for the analysis. After the
      screening of representative microorganisms, their aptitude of pervasiveness
      against drugs was studied. Here, we used antimicrobial agents which are common in
      clinical practice. We also performed studies to investigate the presence of toxin
      genes in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). RESULTS: The results indicate
      that the prevalence of drug-resistant microbes was more pronounced in oral cancer
      patients after initial treatment above 70 years old. The oxacillin resistance of
      S. aureus isolate confirms that the prevalence of MRSA is increasing in
      accordance to age-factor and immune compromise in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study reveals the occurrence of drug-resistant opportunistic microorganisms
      in oral cavity after treatment for oral cancer in aged individuals. Special
      attention should be directed to MRSA during the treatment of oral cancer, and to
      realize the fact of immune compromise in elderly patients.

TI  - Species-specific detection and identification of fusarium species complex, the
      causal agent of sugarcane pokkah boeng in china.
PG  - e104195
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0104195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pokkah boeng disease caused by the Fusarium species complex results
      in significant yield losses in sugarcane. Thus, the rapid and accurate detection
      and identification of the pathogen is urgently required to manage and prevent the
      spreading of sugarcane pokkah boeng. METHODS: A total of 101 isolates were
      recovered from the pokkah boeng samples collected from five major sugarcane
      production areas in China throughout 2012 and 2013. The causal pathogen was
      identified by morphological observation, pathogenicity test, and phylogenetic
      analysis based on the fungus-conserved rDNA-ITS. Species-specific TaqMan
      real-time PCR and conventional PCR methods were developed for rapid and accurate
      detection of the causal agent of sugarcane pokkah boeng. The specificity and
      sensitivity of PCR assay were also evaluated on a total of 84 isolates of
      Fusarium from China and several isolates from other fungal pathogens of
      Sporisorium scitamineum and Phoma sp. and sugarcane endophyte of Acremonium sp.
      RESULT: Two Fusarium species (F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum) that caused
      sugarcane pokahh boeng were identified by morphological observation,
      pathogenicity test, and phylogenetic analysis. Species-specific TaqMan PCR and
      conventional PCR were designed and optimized to target their rDNA-ITS regions.
      The sensitivity of the TaqMan PCR was approximately 10 pg of fungal DNA input,
      which was 1,000-fold over conventional PCR, and successfully detected pokkah
      boeng in the field-grown sugarcane. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study was the
      first to identify two species, F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, that were
      causal pathogens of sugarcane pokkah boeng in China. It also described the
      development of a species-specific PCR assay to detect and confirm these pathogens
      in sugarcane plants from mainland China. This method will be very useful for a
      broad range of research endeavors as well as the regulatory response and
      management of sugarcane pokkah boeng.
