T8	Sentence 0 71	Prediction and preliminary validation of oncogene regulation by miRNAs.
T9	Sentence 72 250	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the most abundant groups of regulatory genes in multicellular organisms, playing important roles in many fundamental cellular processes.
T6	Target 789 804	down-regulation
T7	Target 953 964	suppression
T5	Gene 808 813	c-MYC
T2	MiRNA 977 982	miR16
T3	Gene 968 973	BCL-2
T1	MiRNA 879 884	let-7
T14	Sentence 761 983	We present evidence for the down-regulation of c-MYC, one of the most potent and frequently deregulated oncogenes, by let-7 miRNA, via the predicted binding site in the 3' UTR, and verify the suppression of BCL-2 by miR16.
T15	Sentence 984 1136	CONCLUSION: In this work both bioinformatic and experimental approaches for the prediction and validation of possible targets for miRNAs have been used.
T16	Sentence 1137 1311	A list of putative targets for different oncomirs, validation of which would be of special interest, is proposed and two such interactions have been experimentally validated.
T10	Sentence 251 389	More than four hundred miRNAs have been identified in humans and the deregulation of miRNA expression has been also shown in many cancers.
T11	Sentence 390 563	Despite the postulated involvement of miRNAs in tumourigenesis, there are only a few examples where an oncogene or a tumour suppressor has been identified as a miRNA target.
T12	Sentence 564 653	RESULTS: Here, we present an in silico analysis of potential miRNA-oncogene interactions.
T13	Sentence 654 760	Moreover, we have tested the validity of two possible interactions of miRNAs with genes related to cancer.
