Inhibition of microRNA - 17 improves lung and heart function in experimental pulmonary hypertension .
RATIONALE : MicroRNAs ( miRs ) control various cellular processes in tissue homeostasis and disease by regulating gene expression on the posttranscriptional level .
Recently , it was demonstrated that the expression of <GENE>miR - 21</GENE> and members of the miR - 17 - 92 cluster was significantly altered in experimental pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and antiremodeling potential of <GENE>miR</GENE> inhibitors in the pathogenesis of PH . METHODS : We first tested the effects of miR inhibitors ( antagomirs ) , which were specifically designed to block miR - 17 ( A - 17 ) , miR - 21 ( A - 21 ) , and <GENE>miR - 92a</GENE> ( A - 92a ) in chronic hypoxia - induced PH in mice and A - 17 in monocrotaline - induced PH in rats .
Moreover , biological function of <GENE>miR - 17</GENE> was analyzed in cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells .
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : In the PH mouse model , A - 17 and A - 21 reduced right ventricular systolic pressure , and all antagomirs decreased pulmonary arterial muscularization .
However , only A - 17 reduced hypoxia - induced right ventricular hypertrophy and improved pulmonary artery acceleration time .
In the monocrotaline - induced PH rat model , A - 17 treatment significantly decreased right ventricular systolic pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance index , increased pulmonary artery acceleration time , normalized cardiac output , and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling .
Among the tested <GENE>miR - 17</GENE> targets , the <GENE>cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor 1A</GENE> ( <GENE>p21</GENE> ) was up - regulated in lungs undergoing A - 17 treatment .
Likewise , in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells , A - 17 increased <GENE>p21</GENE> .
Overexpression of <GENE>miR - 17</GENE> significantly reduced <GENE>p21</GENE> expression and increased proliferation of smooth muscle cells .
CONCLUSIONS : Our data demonstrate that A - 17 improves heart and lung function in experimental PH by interfering with lung vascular and right ventricular remodeling .
The beneficial effects may be related to the up - regulation of <GENE>p21</GENE> .
Thus , inhibition of <GENE>miR - 17</GENE> may represent a novel therapeutic concept to ameliorate disease state in PH .
