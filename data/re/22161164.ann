T36	Sentence 1970 2036	The beneficial effects may be related to the up-regulation of p21.
T37	Sentence 2037 2140	Thus, inhibition of miR-17 may represent a novel therapeutic concept to ameliorate disease state in PH.
T34	Sentence 1692 1805	Overexpression of miR-17 significantly reduced p21 expression and increased proliferation of smooth muscle cells.
T35	Sentence 1806 1969	CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that A-17 improves heart and lung function in experimental PH by interfering with lung vascular and right ventricular remodeling.
T32	Sentence 1482 1614	Among the tested miR-17 targets, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21) was up-regulated in lungs undergoing A-17 treatment.
T33	Sentence 1615 1691	Likewise, in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, A-17 increased p21.
T30	Sentence 1077 1198	However, only A-17 reduced hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy and improved pulmonary artery acceleration time.
T31	Sentence 1199 1481	In the monocrotaline-induced PH rat model, A-17 treatment significantly decreased right ventricular systolic pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance index, increased pulmonary artery acceleration time, normalized cardiac output, and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling.

T25	Sentence 99 259	RATIONALE: MicroRNAs (miRs) control various cellular processes in tissue homeostasis and disease by regulating gene expression on the posttranscriptional level.
T24	Sentence 0 98	Inhibition of microRNA-17 improves lung and heart function in experimental pulmonary hypertension.
T27	Sentence 428 795	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and antiremodeling potential of miR inhibitors in the pathogenesis of PH. METHODS: We first tested the effects of miR inhibitors (antagomirs), which were specifically designed to block miR-17 (A-17), miR-21 (A-21), and miR-92a (A-92a) in chronic hypoxia-induced PH in mice and A-17 in monocrotaline-induced PH in rats.
T26	Sentence 260 427	Recently, it was demonstrated that the expression of miR-21 and members of the miR-17-92 cluster was significantly altered in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).
