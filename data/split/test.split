["Oxidative DNA damage correlates with cell immortalization and N1ENTITY expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs expression has been extensively studied in hepatocellular carcinoma but little is known regarding the relationship, if any, with inflammation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), host' s repair mechanisms and cell immortalization.", "This study aimed at assessing the extent of oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-8-OHdG) in different phases of the carcinogenetic process, in relation to DNA repair gene polymorphism, telomeric dysfunction and to the expression of several microRNAs, non-coding genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and death.", "METHODS: Tissue samples obtained either at surgery, [neoplastic (HCC) and adjacent non-cancerous cirrhotic tissues (NCCT)] at percutaneous or laparoscopic biopsy (patients with HCV or HBV-related hepatitis or patients undergoing cholecystectomy) were analysed for 8-OHdG (HPLC-ED), N40ENTITY (a DNA repair gene) polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), N38ENTITY activity, telomere length (T/S, by RT-PCR), Taqman microRNA assay and N39ENTITY/N36ENTITY mRNA (RT-PCR).", "Fifty-eight samples from 29 HCC patients (obtained in both neoplastic and peritumoral tissues), 22 from chronic hepatitis (CH) and 10 controls (cholecystectomy patients-CON) were examined.", "RESULTS: Eight-OHdG levels were significantly higher in HCC and NCCT than in CH and CON (p = 0.001).", "N37ENTITY activity was significantly higher in HCC than in the remaining subgroups (p = 0.002); conversely T/S was significantly lower in HCC (p = 0.05).", "N2ENTITY were down-regulated in the majority of HCCs while N3ENTITY was up-regulated.", "A positive correlation was observed among 8-OHdG levels, disease stage, N35ENTITY activity, N32ENTITY and N33ENTITY/N21ENTITY levels.", "In HCC, N4ENTITY expression correlated positively with N22ENTITY activity, 8-OHdG levels and N23ENTITY/N24ENTITY mRNA.", "CONCLUSIONS: The above findings confirm the accumulation, in the progression of chronic liver damage to HCC, of a ROS-mediated oxidative DNA damage, and suggest that this correlates with induction of N17ENTITY activity and, as a novel finding, with over-expression of N5ENTITY, a microRNA that plays a role in both the apoptotic process and in cellular proliferation pathways.", "MYCN-regulated N6ENTITY inhibits secretion of the tumor N19ENTITY (N20ENTITY) in neuroblastoma.", "The N30ENTITY is frequently amplified in neuroblastoma.", "It is one of the most consistent markers of bad prognosis for this disease.", "N31ENTITY (N44ENTITY) is a secreted protein of the N43ENTITY of N46ENTITY regulators.", "It functions as a tumor suppressor in a range of cancers, including neuroblastoma.", "MYCN was recently found to downregulate N45ENTITY.", "In this study, we show that MYCN knockdown in MYCN-amplified (MNA) neuroblastoma cell lines increases secretion of endogenous N48ENTITY to the culture media.", "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 20 nt long single-stranded RNA molecules that downregulate messenger RNAs by targeting the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR).", "Many miRNAs regulate genes involved in the pathogenesis of cancer and are extensively deregulated in different tumors.", "Using miRNA target prediction software, we found several MYCN-regulated miRNAs that could target the 3' UTR sequence of N47ENTITY, including N7ENTITY, N8ENTITY and N9ENTITY.", "N42ENTITY expression from a reporter vector containing the N41ENTITY was decreased when this construct was cotransfected with N10ENTITY, N11ENTITY or N12ENTITY in HEK293 cells.", "Mutation of the N13ENTITY seed sequence in the 3' UTR completely rescued the observed decrease in reporter expression when cotransfected with N14ENTITY and N15ENTITY.", "Antagomir and miRNA-mimic transfections in neuroblastoma cell lines confirmed that N27ENTITY secretion to the culture media is regulated by N16ENTITY.", "Consistent with reports from other cancers, we found N25ENTITY to be expressed in the endothelium of primary neuroblastoma samples and to be absent in tumors with MYCN amplification.", "Our data demonstrate that MYCN-regulated miRNAs are able to modulate the expression of the tumor suppressor DKK3 in neuroblastoma."]
