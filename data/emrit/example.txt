21303526-1 Serum response factor ( SRF ) regulates certain microRNAs that play a role in cardiac and skeletal muscle development .
23436819-3 We aimed to determine the impact of the SRF transcription factor known to regulate the NCX1 promoter and microRNA genes , on the expression of NCX1 mRNA and protein and Annexin A5 ( AnxA5 ) , a Ca(2+) -binding protein interacting with NCX1 and increased during HF .
19004760-2 The appearance of Hand1 and Smyd1 , transcription and chromatin remodeling factors ; Acta1 , Acta2 , Myl3 , and Myom1 , myofibril proteins ; and calcium-activated potassium-channel gene activity ( KCNMB1 ) , the channel protein , were powerfully attenuated in the Srf ( CKO ) mutant hearts .
23103763-5 Expression of vinculin , matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP-9 ) and integrin BETA1 , three SRF targets and key regulators of cell migration , in injured arteries was significantly weaker in Mkl1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice .
21303526-10 Our study demonstrates that the downregulation of miR-1 , miR-133a , and upregulation of miR-21 can be reversed by one single upstream regulator , SRF .
21303526-7 Furthermore , we observed that SRF regulates microRNA biogenesis , specifically the transcription of pri-microRNA , thereby affecting the mature microRNA level .
19775284-9 MiR-1 was up-regulated in MI , possibly due to the concomitant increase in SRF , a transcriptional activator of the miR-1 gene , accounting for decreased Kir2.1 .
19004760-4 In the absence of SRF genes associated with biomineralization , GATA-6 , bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) , and periostin were strongly up-regulated , coinciding with the down regulation of many SRF dependent microRNA , including miR1 , which exerted robust silencer activity over the induction of GATA-6 leading to the down regulation of BMP4 and periostin .
18371447-4 Here , we show that two serum response factor ( SRF ) -dependent muscle-specific microRNAs , miR-1 and miR-133 , promote mesoderm formation from ES cells but have opposing functions during further differentiation into cardiac muscle progenitors .
21506120-1 Myocardin is a transcriptional co-activator of serum response factor ( SRF ) and can be degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome system .
16380711-7 By contrast , miR-133 enhances myoblast proliferation by repressing serum response factor ( SRF ) .
21303526-9 The mir-21 gene is regulated by SRF and its cofactors , including myocardin and p49/Strap .
19581315-5 Our results further revealed that the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP-Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) signalling pathway contributed to the expression of miR-1 , and serum response factor ( SRF ) , which is known as one of the transcriptional enhancers of miR-1 , was up-regulated in ischaemic myocardium .
21303526-2 However , the role of SRF in the regulation of microRNA expression and microRNA biogenesis in cardiac hypertrophy has not been well established .
23436819-7 MiR-1 , a microRNA regulated by SRF , was decreased in the SRF ( HKO ) and repressed by phenylephrine .
21506120-3 Further studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that proteasome inhibition , although increased the occupancy of myocardin and SRF on the promoter of SM ALPHA-actin gene , abolished myocardin-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II .
19004760-3 A requisite role for combinatorial cofactor interactions with SRF , as a major determinant for regulating the appearance of organized sarcomeres , was shown by viral rescue of SRF-null ES cells with SRF point mutants that block cofactor interactions .
23103763-1 Myocardin-related transcription factor ( MRTF ) -A is a Rho signalling-responsive co-activator of serum response factor ( SRF ) .
21998125-2 Muscle-specific microRNAs and serum response factor ( SRF ) are important regulators of muscle phenotype that contribute to a feedback system to regulate muscle gene expression .
21303526-3 In this report , we employed two distinct transgenic mouse models to study the impact of SRF on cardiac microRNA expression and microRNA biogenesis .
23436819-6 AnxA5 protein expression profile paralleled the expression of NCX1 protein in the SRF ( HKO ) .
21303526-6 Reducing cardiac SRF level using the antisense-SRF transgenic approach ( Anti-SRF-Tg ) resulted in the expression of miR-1 , miR-133a and miR-21 in the opposite direction .
18023168-2 SRF may also direct the expression of microRNAs ( miRs ) that inhibit the expression of cardiac regulatory factors .
19775284-6 Kir2.1 and serum response factor ( SRF ) levels were analysed by Western blot and microRNA-1 ( miR-1 ) level was determined by real-time RT-PCR .
24068960-3 Concomitant knockout of miR-1-1/133a-2 and miR-1-2/133a-1 released suppression of the transcriptional co-activator myocardin , a major regulator of SM gene expression , but not of its binding partner SRF .
21303526-8 The mir-21 promoter sequence is conserved among mouse , rat and human ; one SRF binding site was found to be in the mir-21 proximal promoter region of all three species .
23436819-10 Our study reveals the existence of a complex regulatory loop where SRF regulates the transcription of NCX1 and miR-1 , which in turn functions as a rheostat limiting the translation of NCX1 and AnxA5 proteins .
19581315-6 Moreover , propranolol inhibited the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP-PKA signalling pathway and suppressed SRF expression .
21303526-4 Cardiac-specific overexpression of SRF ( SRF-Tg ) led to altered expression of a number of microRNAs .
20655308-3 Serum response factor ( SRF ) and the MEK1/2 pathway were involved in miR-1 and miR-206 expression in cardiomyocytes .
23436819-4 NCX1 mRNA was decreased while the protein was increased in the failing heart of the cardiomyocyte-restricted SRF knock-out mice ( SRF ( HKO ) ) .
20458751-1 Myocardin , a cofactor of serum response factor ( SRF ) , specifically induces the expression of contractile proteins to promote differentiation and contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) .
21303526-5 Interestingly , downregulation of miR-1 , miR-133a and upregulation of miR-21 occurred by 7 days of age in these mice , long before the onset of cardiac hypertrophy , suggesting that SRF overexpression impacted the expression of microRNAs which contribute to cardiac hypertrophy .
18023168-1 Serum response factor ( SRF ) , a cardiac-enriched transcription factor , is required for the appearance of beating sarcomeres in the heart .
20458751-2 SRF directly induces the transcription of microRNA-1 ( miR-1 ) in cardiac and skeletal muscle precursor cells and miR-1 promotes the skeletal muscle differentiation and modulates cardiac hypertrophy .
23436819-5 The induction of NCX1 mRNA by the pro-hypertrophic drug phenylephrine observed in control mice was abolished in the SRF ( HKO ) though the protein was strongly increased .
21220930-9 Furthermore , tanshinone IIA could inhibit activated p38 MAPK and heart special transcription factors SRF and MEF2 , in ischemic and hypoxic cardiomyocytes .
20458751-6 Our further studies revealed that exogenous miR-1 , which did not affect myocardin or SRF expression , suppressed the expression of contractile proteins , such as alpha-SMA and SM22 , and impaired the actin cytoskeletal organization .
18023168-3 The recent knockout of miR-1-2 , an SRF gene target , showed defective heart development , caused in part by the induction of GATA6 , Irx4/5 , and Hand2 , that may alter cardiac morphogenesis , channel activity , and cell cycling .
24058688-4 In this study , we identify a unique serum response factor ( SRF ) binding motif within the enhancer through bioinformatic approaches .
19775284-10 Treatment with tanshinone IIA prevented increased SRF and hence increased miR-1 post-MI , whereas quinidine did not .
19004760-1 Our conditional serum response factor ( SRF ) knockout , Srf ( Cko ) , in the heart-forming region blocked the appearance of rhythmic beating myocytes , one of the earliest cardiac defects caused by the ablation of a cardiac-enriched transcription factor .
18023168-4 SRF and cofactors play an obligatory role in cardiogenesis , as major determinants of myocyte differentiation not only by regulating the biogenesis of muscle contractile proteins but also by driving the expression of silencer miRNA .

24146179-6 Immunohistochemistry was used to detect Cx43 protein expression .

21785809-5 By using Western blot techniques , M₃-mAChR overexpression also rescued the expression of the inward rectifying K⁺ channel subunit Kir2.1 after myocardial I/R injury .
19959133-16 Ex vivo tachystimulation of human atrial slices up-regulated Kir2.1 and down-regulated miR-1 , suggesting a primary role of atrial rate in miR-1 down-regulation and I ( K1 ) up-regulation .
19959133-17 miR-1 levels are greatly reduced in human AF , possibly contributing to up-regulation of Kir2.1 subunits , leading to increased I ( K1 ) .
17401374-6 miR-1 overexpression slowed conduction and depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane by post-transcriptionally repressing KCNJ2 ( which encodes the K(+) channel subunit Kir2.1 ) and GJA1 ( which encodes connexin 43 ) , and this likely accounts at least in part for its arrhythmogenic potential .

24252873-7 miR-1 repressed Telokin expression through direct targeting and by repressing its transcriptional regulator , Myocardin .
21506120-6 In summary , our results have suggested that proteasomal degradation of myocardin is required for its transcriptional activity .
23359472-7 Interestingly , adult myocardin heterozygous-knockout mice showed normal increases in bladder and body weight but lower bladder capacity compared to WT mice .
23103763-0 Reciprocal expression of MRTF-A and myocardin is crucial for pathological vascular remodelling in mice .
21506120-1 Myocardin is a transcriptional co-activator of serum response factor ( SRF ) and can be degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome system .
21051663-4 In this study , we investigated whether myocardin induces miR-1 expression to mediate its inhibitory effects on SMC proliferation .
21303526-9 The mir-21 gene is regulated by SRF and its cofactors , including myocardin and p49/Strap .
21506120-3 Further studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that proteasome inhibition , although increased the occupancy of myocardin and SRF on the promoter of SM ALPHA-actin gene , abolished myocardin-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II .
23359472-5 Myocardin heterozygous-knockout mice exhibited reduced expression of Myocd mRNA and several SMC contractile genes concurrent with bladder SMC hypersensitivity that was mediated by gap junctions .
24068960-4 Overexpression of myocardin in the embryonic heart essentially recapitulated the miR-1/133a mutant phenotype at the molecular level , arresting embryonic cardiomyocytes in an immature state .
20458751-7 Taken together , our results have revealed that myocardin induces miR-1 expression , which represses the expression of contractile proteins and thereby inhibits the contractility of SMCs .
21506120-4 We further examined the degradation of myocardin in epithelioid and spindle-shaped SMCs and revealed that myocardin in more differentiated spindle-shaped SMCs was more quickly degraded and had shorter half-life than in epithelioid SMCs .
24068960-3 Concomitant knockout of miR-1-1/133a-2 and miR-1-2/133a-1 released suppression of the transcriptional co-activator myocardin , a major regulator of SM gene expression , but not of its binding partner SRF .
21506120-0 Proteasomal degradation of myocardin is required for its transcriptional activity in vascular smooth muscle cells .
21506120-2 Our preliminary studies unexpectedly revealed that accumulation of myocardin in response to proteasome inhibition by MG132 or lactacystin resulted in decrease of transcriptional activity of myocardin as indicated by reduced expression of SMC contractile marker genes ( SM ALPHA-actin , SM22 , and calponin ) and muscle-enriched microRNAs ( miR-143/145 and miR-1/133a ) , and reduced contractility of human vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) embedded in collagen gel lattices , suggesting that myocardin degradation is required for its transcriptional activity .
21051663-3 Recently , myocardin was reported to induce the expression of microRNA-1 ( miR-1 ) in cardiomyocytes .
21051663-5 Using tetracycline-regulated expression ( T-REx ) inducible system expressing myocardin in human vascular SMCs , we found that overexpression of myocardin resulted in significant induction of miR-1 expression and inhibition of SMC proliferation , which was reversed by miR-1 inhibitors .
24068960-6 Finally , we show that myocardin positively regulates expression of miR-1/133a , thus constituting a negative feedback loop that is essential for early cardiac development.
23103763-3 MRTF-A expression was significantly higher in the wire-injured femoral arteries of wild-type mice and in the atherosclerotic aortic tissues of ApoE(-/-) mice than in healthy control tissues , whereas myocardin expression was significantly lower .

21051663-11 Furthermore , neointimal lesions of mouse carotid arteries displayed downregulation of myocardin and miR-1 with upregulation of Pim-1 .
20458751-4 We found that miR-1 expression was induced by myocardin overexpression in human aortic SMCs .
21506120-5 In neointimal lesions , we found that stabilization of myocardin protein was companied by downregulation of transcripts of ubiquitin and proteasome subunits , further illustrating the mechanism underlying reduction of myocardin transcriptional activity .
20458751-1 Myocardin , a cofactor of serum response factor ( SRF ) , specifically induces the expression of contractile proteins to promote differentiation and contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) .
20458751-5 In a collagen lattice contraction assay using SMCs harboring a doxycycline-inducible expression system for myocardin , we found that myocardin expression increased the contractility of SMCs , which was significantly inhibited by exogenous miR-1 .
21051663-0 Induction of microRNA-1 by myocardin in smooth muscle cells inhibits cell proliferation .
23487791-5 Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors , including GATA binding protein 4 , Hand2 , T-box5 , and myocardin , and two microRNAs , miR-1 and miR-133 , activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts .
23359472-3 We report the involvement of myocardin ( MYOCD ) and microRNA-1 ( miR-1 ) in the regulation of connexin 43 ( GJA1 ) , a major gap junction in bladder smooth muscle , and the collective role of these molecules during post-natal bladder development .
20458751-6 Our further studies revealed that exogenous miR-1 , which did not affect myocardin or SRF expression , suppressed the expression of contractile proteins , such as alpha-SMA and SM22 , and impaired the actin cytoskeletal organization .
21051663-8 Correspondingly , spindle-shaped SMCs had significantly higher expression levels of both myocardin and miR-1 than epithelioid SMCs .
20458751-8 Therefore , our findings suggest a role of miR-1 in the negative feedback loop in the regulation of contractility induced by myocardin .

15504838-3 Although the sequence for the promoter ( prA ) that drives expression of Enterobacter cloacae chromosomal ampC is present upstream of bla ( MIR-1 ) , high-level expression from bla ( MIR-1 ) is directed from a hybrid promoter ( prB ) located further upstream of prA .
17051471-7 However , not all enterobacteria are resistant only because of ESBLs , but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded AmpC Beta-lactamase of class C ( MIR-1 , CMY-1 , BIL-1 , FOX-1 , MOX-1 , DHA-1 , ACC-1 ) , resistant to Beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin ( Enterobacter spp , Proteus vulgaris , Citrobacter freundii , Morganelle spp , Serratia spp ) .
